# Over 1,000 educational videos for children

Access to a variety of high-quality educational videos is essential to enrich students' learning. They allow visualization of abstract concepts, discovery of different ways of learning, and immersion in otherwise inaccessible environments. However, it is often difficult to find videos that meet the specific needs of children and are free, copyright-free, and ad-free.

This is why Sugarizer provides access to a collection of over 1,000 educational videos covering a variety of subjects and themes. Let's explore them in this article.

Users can also search by name, allowing them to quickly find a particular video without having to browse through all the resources. Additionally, to enhance the learning experience, it is possible to mark favorite videos. This feature allows users to create a personalized list of videos they wish to revisit, providing a simple and effective way to find their favorite content.

## A Variety of Educational Videos

Three collections of educational videos are currently available in Sugarizer, each offering unique content tailored to different learning levels. These collections are:

### Khan Academy

### Art4apps

Art4apps focuses on learning syllables in English and French through fun and engaging videos. Each video presents a syllable accompanied by a short story featuring animals, allowing students to contextualize the syllables in fun and memorable situations. This narrative approach not only facilitates phonetic understanding but also stimulates children's imagination, making syllable learning both interactive and entertaining.
