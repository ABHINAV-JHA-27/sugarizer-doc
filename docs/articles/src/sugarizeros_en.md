# SugarizerOS: Turn your Android tablet into a powerful educational tool

SugarizerOS is a version of the Sugarizer application that replaces the Android launcher screen. SugarizerOS transforms your Android tablet into an integrated educational platform. Let's explore SugarizerOS and its features.

## Two in one: Sugarizer and Android

With SugarizerOS, the home screen of your Android tablet becomes Sugarizer. As soon as you turn on your device, you have direct access to Sugarizer's educational activities. This allows for total immersion in the educational world of Sugarizer, making it easier for children to engage and simplifying tablet usage.

But SugarizerOS is not limited to running Sugarizer activities. It also integrates Android ecosystem applications, allowing you to enjoy the richness and diversity of available educational apps.

For example, the GCompris application, known for its educational quality, can be integrated into SugarizerOS and used just like any other Sugarizer activity.

Installing Android apps on SugarizerOS is a breeze. Simply download them from the Play Store, and they will automatically be visible in SugarizerOS.

## An immersive and integrated experience

With SugarizerOS, launching Android apps becomes as easy as opening a Sugarizer activity. You can select your favorite apps and add them to your favorites, placing them alongside Sugarizer activities for quick and easy access.
