# Fundamental learning with Sugarizer

The strength of the Sugarizer platform lies in its ability to facilitate the teaching of basic skills in elementary school. Let's find out how.

## What are basic skills?

The core skills taught in elementary school vary from country to country, but in general, they cover a number of key areas for the development of basic skills in pupils. 
Here are just a few of the areas in which Sugarizer can help:
* Reading and writing
* Mathematics
* Science and simulation
* Geography and exploration
* Art education
* Computer science and programming

## Reading and writing
Literacy is one of the essential pillars of primary education. Students learn to recognize, read and write letters, words and sentences. They also develop their reading comprehension and learn to express themselves in writing.

Sugarizer offers a number of activities for reading and writing, including :
