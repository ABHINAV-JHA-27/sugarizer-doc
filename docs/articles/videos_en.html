<h1>Over 1,000 educational videos for children</h1>
<p>Access to a variety of high-quality educational videos is essential to enrich students' learning. They allow visualization of abstract concepts, discovery of different ways of learning, and immersion in otherwise inaccessible environments. However, it is often difficult to find videos that meet the specific needs of children and are free, copyright-free, and ad-free.</p>
<p>This is why Sugarizer provides access to a collection of over 1,000 educational videos covering a variety of subjects and themes. Let's explore them in this article.</p>
<p><div class="text-center"><img src="images/videos1.png" class="ms-3 img-fluid p-2 bg-light border" width="800px" alt="Sugarizer's video collections"></div><figcaption class="ms-3 figure-caption text-center">Sugarizer's video collections</figcaption></p>
<h2>The Video Viewer Activity</h2>
<p>The Video Viewer activity is the access point to Sugarizer's collection of educational videos. The activity allows users to browse through the videos by library and theme, making it easier to find specific content based on areas of interest.</p>
<p><div class="text-center"><img src="videos/videos5.gif" class="ms-3 img-fluid p-2 bg-light border" width="800px" alt="The Video Viewer Activity"></div><figcaption class="ms-3 figure-caption text-center">The Video Viewer Activity</figcaption></p>
<p>Users can also search by name, allowing them to quickly find a particular video without having to browse through all the resources. Additionally, to enhance the learning experience, it is possible to mark favorite videos. This feature allows users to create a personalized list of videos they wish to revisit, providing a simple and effective way to find their favorite content.</p>
<h2>A Variety of Educational Videos</h2>
<p>Three collections of educational videos are currently available in Sugarizer, each offering unique content tailored to different learning levels. These collections are:</p>
<h3>Khan Academy</h3>
<p>Khan Academy is a renowned organization for its free educational videos covering a multitude of subjects, from mathematics to science to history. These videos are designed to explain concepts clearly and concisely on a virtual blackboard, making it easier for students to understand.</p>
<p><div class="text-center"><img src="images/videos2.png" class="ms-3 img-fluid p-2 bg-light border" width="800px" alt="Khan Academy"></div><figcaption class="ms-3 figure-caption text-center">Khan Academy</figcaption></p>
<p>By using Khan Academy videos, teachers can offer visual and engaging explanations that complement classroom activities. The videos are available in English, French, and Spanish.</p>
<h3>Art4apps</h3>
<p>Art4apps focuses on learning syllables in English and French through fun and engaging videos. Each video presents a syllable accompanied by a short story featuring animals, allowing students to contextualize the syllables in fun and memorable situations. This narrative approach not only facilitates phonetic understanding but also stimulates children's imagination, making syllable learning both interactive and entertaining.</p>
<p><div class="text-center"><img src="images/videos3.png" class="ms-3 img-fluid p-2 bg-light border" width="800px" alt="Art4apps"></div><figcaption class="ms-3 figure-caption text-center">Art4apps</figcaption></p>
<p>By using Art4apps resources, teachers can provide content to reinforce classroom learning. The videos are available in English and French, which can be a good way to learn the basics of a foreign language.</p>
<h3>Réseau Canopé</h3>
<p>The Réseau Canopé, which produces educational resources for teachers, also offers educational videos and interactive tools. These contents are specifically designed for the French educational system and align with the school curricula.</p>
<p><div class="text-center"><img src="images/videos4.png" class="ms-3 img-fluid p-2 bg-light border" width="800px" alt="Réseau Canopé"></div><figcaption class="ms-3 figure-caption text-center">Réseau Canopé</figcaption></p>
<p>The videos cover French language, mathematics, science, history, geography, civic education, and music. Integrating Canopé videos into Sugarizer ensures the relevance and compliance of resources with French educational expectations.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Sugarizer offers easy and free access to a variety of quality educational videos. Teachers and students can explore, learn, and be inspired by these rich and varied resources.</p>
