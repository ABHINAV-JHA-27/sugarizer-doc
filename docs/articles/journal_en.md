# The Journal

In Sugarizer, there is no need to save your work, the Journal is the place that automatically keeps a history of everything you do. Let's explore it together.

## Open the Journal

The Journal can be accessed by clicking on the icon just below the central character.

The Journal shows in the order of the last launch all the activities that have been executed. Click on the icon of an activity to reopen it from the Journal.

Using the top bar of the Journal you can search, filter or sort the contents of the Journal to explore what you have done.


## Find your work

To make it easier to find a job, you can give it a name. This is done from each activity by clicking on the activity icon and typing the new name.

This is the name that will be displayed in the Journal. You can also change the name from the Journal by clicking on it.

For even more convenience, you can mark an item in the Journal as "Favorite". To do this, click on the star in front of the item's name. You can then display only the favorites by clicking on the star in the top bar.


## Journal and home page

On the Sugarizer homepage, you can distinguish between activities you have already run and activities you have not yet used. The icon of the activities you have already run is colored with your colors.

If you click on an activity you have already used it will open in the state you left it.

If you leave the mouse on an activity for a few seconds (or leave your finger pressed on it), a menu appears with the last executions of the activity. You can open the one you want or create a new job.
